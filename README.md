# minerva
A ((heavily) work in progress) linguistics library. <br>
The idea is, a collection of scripts and binaries for various linguistics, natural-language things.<br>
I'm no expert in linguistics, but I have a use for some things, and couldn't find any existing libraries in Nim to use, so I decided to give it a try as a little project.<br>
Some ideas and concepts will be inspired by [Wink.js](https://winkjs.org/packages.html) and [TextBlob](https://pypi.org/project/textblob/) in Python.

# Markov Chains
**Status**: Functional <br>
Simple natural language generation using fed lines, and randomly generating a sentence from that.
## To-do
- [ ] Sentence completion based on input instead of complete random. e.i. m.generate("this is") -> "this is a thing you can do"

# Naive Bayes classifier
**Status**: Concept <br>
I really have no idea how to start on this one yet, but maybe with enough research I'll work how how the formula works.

# Wordnet
**Status**: Concept<br>
Using Wordnets database to classify words.

# Wiktionary
**Status**: Concept<br>
Quick lookup of words from wiktionary

# Others
To expand later.
